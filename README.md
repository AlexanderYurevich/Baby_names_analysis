# Research on baby names in the US
The United States Social Security Administration (SSA) has made available data on the frequency of baby names from 1880 to 2010. It's stored in babyname file.
<br>In my research I will:
- Organize the data into a convenient form
- Analyze various naming trends of interest
- Measure the increase in naming diversity
- Test "The last letter revolution" theory by Laura Wattenberg, she pointed out that the distribution of
boy names by final letter has changed significantly over the last 100 years
- Watch on some boy names that became girl names
